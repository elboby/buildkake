Buildkake
---

h1. Introduction
Buildkake is a simple build tool for PHP projects. It is like a very very very simplistic wannabe of Ant for Java, Rebar for Erlang or Leiningen for Clojure.
The idea is to handle versions, dependencies and simple builds. Our projects use more and more plugins, libraries maintained independently; so this maintenance task is critical. 
One problem to solve was to have a better strategy than "git submodule" to deal with dependencies.

h2. Usage
Very simple, you just need a configuration file in the root of your project and launch buildkake like this:
$ cd my_project
$ buildkake build.config.php
...

It will:
* download the different libraries and components according to the config file and put them in the current location.
* if already downloaded, it will check if updates are needed and download them.
* check dependencies according to config file (very simple).
* execute user specific scripts before and after building (like email, growl, symfony pake tasks...).
* handle ignore files for your versioning.
